                <p>
                    Bergen Routes started when the members of the Computer Technology Club at Bergen Community College
                    decided to make finding their meeting room easier for new members. The idea expanded to encompass the
                    whole
                    campus. Soon Bergen Routes became an official project supported by the STEM Student Scholar Program.
                    This provided the team with critical funds, sourced via federal grants.

                <h1>The Internship</h1>
                <p>
                    As an internship project within the 3SP program, the Bergen Routes team chose Dr.
                    Emily Vandalovsky, Dean of STEM, as a mentor. The project quickly picked up popularity
                    and recruited a total of 13 developers.

                    Over the course of its production our team tackled challenges such as implementing routing algorithms,
                    managing and collecting data, and building a good UX.

                <h1>What we Achieved</h1>
                <p>
                    Bergen Routes won first place in a poster competition, running against multiple computer science
                    related projects. The project facilitated the development of a special set of tools and processes
                    for managing 360Â° images. These tools could one day contribute to a more large scale project.

                    The original members of Bergen Routes have since graduated, the project itself has been
                    rebranded and continues to be developed under the name [new brand].
