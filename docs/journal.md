**Summary / About:**
Header: A Wayfinding App for the Future
Content: In the age of portable electronics, the use of maps and directories have become defunct. Bergen Routes is a web based application designed to assist users in navigating large buildings.

Initial proposal will show give a brief description of the applications inception through the cs club.
Production will showcase the team giving presentations and such
